Interfacing of Arduino- part 2
Interfacing Ardunio in Simulink witth DHT11 and Ultrasonic sensor 

We Interfaced Ultrasonic sensor and found out the distance between the sensor and object and also a alarm rings if object comes near to the sensor. 
We also interfaced DHT 11 sensor to gives the readings of Temperature and humidity .
